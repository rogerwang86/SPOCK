# SPOCK-Shuttle Pathfinder Orbiter Construction Kit (WIP)
#### A stockalike FAM Pathfinder mod for Kerbal Space Program

What is this mod?

SPOCK recreate a type of vehicle appeared in the show "For all Mankind", season 2. This vehicle is described as an air-launch, nuclear power next generation shuttle orbiter.

This mod didn't swallow everything from the show but add some changing and expansion for gameplay, like: aft RCS, splittable elevon, drag chute etc.
And because this mod is referenced from Benjee's [SOCK(Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/186023-112x-shuttle-orbiter-construction-kit-stockalike-space-shuttle-orbiter-tubes-v118/)
, many SOCK's equipments are suitable for this mod, too.
 However, based on its performance in the show, the ship will be a little Kraken drive.

### WIP notes:
- SPOCK don't includes the air-launch carrier now.
- It still not well balance yet.
- The main engine model not finished yet. So I take Nertea's ReStock Vector engine(RS-25) as a temporary model.
